The Winning Structure
Start with a powerful hook (first line)
Make a bold, attention-grabbing statement
Promise valuable insight or an unconventional perspective
You have about 1/8 of a second to capture attention
Take a strong stance (main body)
Choose one side of an argument and commit fully
Avoid nuance or balanced perspectives
Use confident, authoritative language
Make your point in clear, concise language
Support with specificity (details)
Add precise numbers (e.g., "20 hours a week casting spells")
Include relatable examples that create vivid mental images
Use specific scenarios people can visualize
Close with impact (optional follow-up)
Consider a double-down tweet that reinforces your position
Add a call to action if relevant
Link to resources when appropriate
Topic Selection
Choose topics that:
You genuinely believe in (authenticity matters)
Polarize opinion (not everyone will agree)
Relate to universal experiences (parenting, business, lifestyle)
Challenge conventional wisdom
Solve problems for your target audience
Psychology Behind Viral Tweets
Embrace controversy
"If you try to make everybody love you, nobody will actually have an opinion on you"
Be willing to ruffle feathers and look silly sometimes
Accept that some people will disagree with you
Provide value in one of three ways:
Make people laugh (entertainment)
Strike emotion (provocation)
Teach something useful (education)
Use visual media strategically
Include video for higher engagement when relevant
Quote retweet others' content and add your perspective
Use media to illustrate your point (like Nick's use of candidate videos)
Formatting Tips
Keep it concise
Break up text into digestible chunks
Use simple language everyone can understand
Avoid hedging words ("maybe," "sometimes," "possibly")
Use numbers and statistics to add credibility
Include specific details rather than generalizations
Content Mix Strategy
Personal insights: Share strong opinions on everyday topics
Value-adding content: Teach followers something useful
Entertaining content: Make followers laugh or smile
Business promotions: Occasional "right hooks" after multiple "jabs" of value
Remember: A good tweet creates a pattern interrupt in someone mindlessly scrolling. You want them to stop and think "wait, what?" before continuing.
The most important lesson from Nick Huber: "Nuance does not go viral." Be bold, be specific, be memorable.
